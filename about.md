## About us

Hi there,

We are a team of three: father (Hung), daughter (Amanda) and son (Chris).

I work as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, and Amanda and Chris are juniors in high school.

This product first started out as a one weekend project for personal use. Then I got a few emails inquiring about it. Soon, it became quite clear that I need to treat this as a release product: it needs to be built, QA’ed, packaged and released properly. I also need to create a web site, get the word out, handle customer emails … Then it dawned on me that this project  would be a perfect vehicle to introduce my daughter and son to what it is like to create a product, market it, support it and interact with paying customers. And that is how Amanda and Chris got involved!

We strive to make you a happy customer.

We make sure our product is well-tested and works correctly the first time.
On our website, we clearly explain what our product does.
If you have questions or concerns, we will give your email our full attention and get back to you promptly.

Thank you for your support,

Hung/Amanda/Chris
