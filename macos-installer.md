## MacOS installer (Beta)

The MacOS installer is currently in Beta.

* The installer contains a copy of the JVM so you don't need to install Java separatedly.
* The installer is NOT [code signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_signing) so you will get a couple of extra warnings from the OS.
* Download: [ac2ofx-1.0.5.pkg](https://bitbucket.org/hleofxquotesteam/dist-applecardstmt/downloads/ac2ofx-1.0.5.pkg)
* Do NOT just double-click file ac2ofx-1.0.5.pkg. See next step.
* Right-click (or control-click) file ac2ofx-1.0.5.pkg and choose “Open” (see [this link](https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/right-click-3610351/) if you are not sure how to right-click).
* Click the “Open” button at the next dialog warning to launch the installer
* ac2ofx wil be installed into your "Applications" folder.
