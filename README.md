## Apple Card spending history as OFX/QFX/QBO file
"Can I import my Apple Card transactions into my financial management program?".

Yes, you can.

ac2ofx makes it possible to import your Apple Card transactions into your financial management program such as Quicken, Moneydance, Microsoft Money ...

It is a simple two-steps process

* Use ac2ofx to convert the "Monthly PDF Statement" into an OFX/QFX/QBO file.
* Then import the OFX/QFX/QBO file into your financial management program.

You can download and eval the tool to see if it fits your need.

**In eval mode, ac2ofx is fully functional but limits the number of transactions in the OFX/QFX/QBO file (5 transations).**

You can obtain a key to remove this limit. The cost is $12.99. Send email to ac2ofx@gmail.com
